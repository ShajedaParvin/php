\section{Challenge}
Data management will be the biggest challenge on our project. An e-commerce site will contain a huge amount of data such as customer data, product details etcetera. Before taking any order we have to make sure that the customer's details are genuine and they will surely take the parcel so that we can save ourselves from wasting time on fraud people. And the second challenge will be keeping track of the product. The details of our products will continuously change as a result it will be a little difficult to store these data.
